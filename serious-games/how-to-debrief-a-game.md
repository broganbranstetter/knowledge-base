# How to debrief a game ?

## 5 steps to debrief a game

As a facilitator you can follow those 5 steps in order to make the debrief efficient :

### **1\) Feeling** **Let the participants talk**

* How did you feel during the exercise ?
* What did you feel ?

### **2\) Proofreading** After the feeling, **gather the facts**.

* What happened ?
* How did it go ?
* What difficulties have emerged ? When ?

### **3\) Learnings** Participants try to **theorize** their experience.

* What did you learn ?
* What did you become aware of during this game ?
* What would you have changed to reach a better result ?

### **4\) Contextualization** Participants must try to **transpose it to their own professional context**.

* What parallel could you do with your professional context ?
* Have you had a sense of “déjà vu” ?
* What is your interest in your work or your daily life ?
* Did it seem realistic / exaggerated, why ?

### **5\) Knowledge transfer** **Deliver theoretical insight** and evoke all the lessons that can be learned from the game.

> At the end, demonstrate that the **game is a formidable weapon**!!!
