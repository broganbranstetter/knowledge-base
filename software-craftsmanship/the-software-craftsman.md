## Book notes

### Introduction 

* Good senior developer in the 90's : No one else can understand his code 
* Working code 
  * The minimum for a professional 
  * How it is done is as important as getting it done 
* Is
  * A mindset 
    * For developers
    * For companies 
  * Adoption of (XP) 
    * Practices 
    * Disciplines 
  * Not a methodology

### Ideology

#### A new reality

What modern developers do :

* Coding (But not only)
* Speak to customers 
* Automate tests/deployment 
* Make technical choices 
* Work in distributed teams 
* Help clients to define and prioritize requirements 
* Present products to potential clients/partners 
* Help with pre-sales activities 
* Estimate time & costs 
* Interview new team members 
* Design and evolve software architecture 
* Understand business goals 
* Make decisions based on trade-offs 
* Keep an eye on new technologies/methodologies 
* ...

{% hint style="info" %}
With agile methodologies, mentality is evolving. More collaboration and dev are now more proud to be dev
{% endhint %}

#### Agile 

* 2 types of disciplines
  * Process oriented (Value)
    * Plan 
    * Measure velocity 
    * Roles people should play 
    * Meetings 
    * ... 
  * Technical Oriented 
    * TDD 
    * Continuous integration 
    * ... 

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Agility is about building the right thing, Craftsmanship is about building the thing right **_
{% endhint %}

* "Craftsmanship over crap", Robert C. Martin (2008) 
* Team = responsible of the realization (all aspects) 
* **Being good at writing code is the minimum skill expected from software professionals"**

#### Why do agile transformations fail ? 

* In software project 
  * Most important deliverable = software itself 
* Change their process through coaching 
* **Nothing to help writing better software** 
* Agile coaches 
  * Mainly focused on process 
  * Not focused on technical excellence

#### Abstract

* To remain competitive companies need to deliver
  * Software faster 
  * With better quality 
* Agile vs software craftsmanship 
  * Agile 
    * Adopting Scrum 
    * Daily stand-up 
    * Manage backlog 
    * Manage W.I.P 
  * Agility does not 
    * Improve magically the quality of the software 
    * Make developers better 
* Complements each other / need to be focused on both 
  * Improve the process 
  * Improve technical excellence

### The Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship (2008)

#### 4 values

`Not only working software, but also well-crafted software`

* Think about a software 
  * Without 
    * Tests 
    * Team to explain code 
  * You have to maintain and develop on it 
  * It is a working software... 
* Reasons of failures 
  * Bad business strategy 
  * Bad project management 
  * Big Time To Market Organization do not pay attention to code quality 
* Well-crafted 
  * Automated tests 
  * TDD
  * Business language in code 
  * Simple design 
* Quality of the code 
  * Only visible by dev 
  * No time allowed to refactor 

{% hint style="danger" %}
Quality of the code may not guarantee the success of a project But can be the main cause of failure.
{% endhint %}

`Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value`

* Not just
  * Adding new features 
  * Fixing bugs 
* BUT also 
  * Improve constantly structure of the code

* Sharing 
  * Knowledge
