## Book notes

### Introduction&#x20;

* Good senior developer in the 90's : No one else can understand his code&#x20;
* Working code&#x20;
  * The minimum for a professional&#x20;
  * How it is done is as important as getting it done&#x20;
* Is
  * A mindset&#x20;
    * For developers
    * For companies&#x20;
  * Adoption of (XP)&#x20;
    * Practices&#x20;
    * Disciplines&#x20;
  * Not a methodology

### Ideology

#### A new reality

What modern developers do :

* Coding (But not only)
* Speak to customers&#x20;
* Automate tests/deployment&#x20;
* Make technical choices&#x20;
* Work in distributed teams&#x20;
* Help clients to define and prioritize requirements&#x20;
* Present products to potential clients/partners&#x20;
* Help with pre-sales activities&#x20;
* Estimate time & costs&#x20;
* Interview new team members&#x20;
* Design and evolve software architecture&#x20;
* Understand business goals&#x20;
* Make decisions based on trade-offs&#x20;
* Keep an eye on new technologies/methodologies&#x20;
* ...

{% hint style="info" %}
With agile methodologies, mentality is evolving. More collaboration and dev are now more proud to be dev
{% endhint %}

#### Agile&#x20;

* 2 types of disciplines
  * Process oriented (Value)
    * Plan&#x20;
    * Measure velocity&#x20;
    * Roles people should play&#x20;
    * Meetings&#x20;
    * ...&#x20;
  * Technical Oriented&#x20;
    * TDD&#x20;
    * Continuous integration&#x20;
    * ...&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Agility is about building the right thing, Craftsmanship is about building the thing right**_&#x20;
{% endhint %}

* "Craftsmanship over crap", Robert C. Martin (2008)&#x20;
* Team = responsible of the realization (all aspects)&#x20;
* **Being good at writing code is the minimum skill expected from software professionals"**

#### Why do agile transformations fail ?&#x20;

* In software project&#x20;
  * Most important deliverable = software itself&#x20;
* Change their process through coaching&#x20;
* **Nothing to help writing better software**&#x20;
* Agile coaches&#x20;
  * Mainly focused on process&#x20;
  * Not focused on technical excellence

#### Abstract

* To remain competitive companies need to deliver
  * Software faster&#x20;
  * With better quality&#x20;
* Agile vs software craftsmanship&#x20;
  * Agile&#x20;
    * Adopting Scrum&#x20;
    * Daily stand-up&#x20;
    * Manage backlog&#x20;
    * Manage W.I.P&#x20;
  * Agility does not&#x20;
    * Improve magically the quality of the software&#x20;
    * Make developers better&#x20;
* Complements each other / need to be focused on both&#x20;
  * Improve the process&#x20;
  * Improve technical excellence

### The Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship (2008)

`Not only working software, but also well-crafted software`

* Think about a software&#x20;
  * Without&#x20;
    * Tests&#x20;

* Quality of the code&#x20;
