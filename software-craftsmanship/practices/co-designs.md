description: From high level Architecture to Solution Design by working collaboratively

# Co-designs

Co-construct the design of the solutions / solution architecture in order to :

* Guarantee the quality of the deliverables
* Be more confident on the Solution we design â†’ "**If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together." - African proverb**
* Their compliance with the expectations of the various technical stakeholders \(Security, Ops, DB experts, ...\)

### Who ?

#### **Required**

* Tech leads / team members from the teams concerned by the High Level Architecture
* At least 1 member of the Architecture team
* 1 facilitator

#### Optional

Regarding the topics other people can have a real added value :

* Other teams representatives concerned by the High Level Architecture
* Enterprise Architects
* Ops
* Security
* Domain experts
* Other technical experts

### What ?

For each new big feature, **bring together the team that will work on the topic as well as the technical experts in order to co-construct the future solution** including for example :

* Definition of the Architecture Characteristics \(Non Functional Requirements\)
  * Based on business needs
* Definition of the expected logs / monitoring solution
* Definition of the integrations
* Data models
* Taking into account infrastructure and security constraints
* ...

### How ?

* **Prepare** the session :
  * Define the **subject** \(_the need_\)
  * Define the **objective** \(_the solution_\)
  * Prepare something to "break"
    * It can be draft of diagrams on a white-board for example
  * Identify who must / need to be there during the session
* A session is **ready when it respects the Definition Of Ready** \(DOR\)
  * In a DOR you could find : Business capabilities concerned, Draft of API contract, Collaboration diagram depending on the topic of the session

### Outcomes

* ADR \(Architecture Decision Record\)
  * Explaining which decisions have been taken and why
* Diagrams drawn and agreed during the session
  * Serve as an input for the Solution Design
* Update of the Tech-radar \(add something in Assess for example\)

### Pros

* Tackle complex problems in small sessions
  * You have all the brilliant mind in the same space to solve the problems
* Shorten feedback loops
* Increase organizational Knowledge Sharing
