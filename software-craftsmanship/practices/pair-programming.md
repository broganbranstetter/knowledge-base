## Concepts - 20'

* Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET3Q6zNK3Io)
  * Ask them what they have seen
  * What are the other pros and cons explained
* Be sure that everyone has understood the roles : Drive / Navigator

| Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- |
| Instantly shared best practices / knowledge | Tiring |
| Improved design / code quality \(fewer mistakes\)  | Can create frictions |
| Faster on-boarding  |  |
| Increase moral / confidence |  |
| Increase team cohesion / collective ownership |  |
| Instant code reviews |  |

* Pair programming is not 1 person sleeping and only one working.

### What about the cost of TDD ?

* The Costs and Benefits of Pair Programming Alistair Cockburn & Laurie Williams
  * The development cost is approximately 15% higher
  * BUT this is repaid in :
    * Shorter and less expensive testing
    * Higher quality assurance
    * Less field support

## Concrete Practice - Create your check-list - 20'

* Think about key factors to make successful pair programming sessions
* Create a check-list

### Example of check-list :

* [ ] Communicate – without violence
  * To propose an idea : “I think...” 
  * To confirm agreement : “Do we agree...” 
  * To discuss progress towards goals : “We agree...” 
  * Avoid saying “No” / ”But”
    * Instead try saying, “Yes and...” 
  * Ask “What would it take to get you in..” if you’re disagree about a proposed idea 
* [ ] Talk / listen a lot
* [ ] Switch roles often
* [ ] Take breaks / Disconnect
* [ ] Chit chat when there is friction

### How to start in your team ?

![Pair Programming Matrix from Jimmy Janlen](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28487%29.png)

* WHY ?
  * To do more pair programming
  * Visualize how much you pair during a week/sprint
* HOW ?
  * Whenever you’ve done a pairing session, make a tick in the corresponding box
