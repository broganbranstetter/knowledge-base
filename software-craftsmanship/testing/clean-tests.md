Debriefing is available in the slide deck

### Concepts

![](broken-reference)Before going further regarding the concepts, invite them to reflect on they define :

* What is a Unit ?
* Which tests they would write on the giving piece of code ?
* How they would write it ?

Then explain all those concepts :

* Schools of testing
* Pillars of Good Unit Tests
* FIRST Principles
* Anatomy of Unit Tests
* How to name your Unit Tests
* Styles of Code
