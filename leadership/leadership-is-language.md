# Leadership is language

## Pitch

Few of us realize that our language in the workplace inhibits creative problem-solving and escalates uncertainty and stress. In both high-pressure situations and everyday scenarios, in each meeting and email, we have the opportunity to empower our colleagues by using the right words.

In Leadership is Language, Former US navy captain David Marquet expands on his bestselling leadership book Turn the Ship Around! and shows managers and leaders the next step in their development: how to enable their team through communication.

Marquet outlines a set of principles and tools that help leaders inspire their people to take responsibility and address challenges without waiting to be told what to do, highlighting how small changes in language can lead to dramatic changes in a team's success and happiness.

## Notes

### Santa FÃ©

* A system over which had little control 
  * What we could control 
  * How we talked to each other 
    * _**Starting with me**_

{% hint style="success" %}
Changing the way we communicated, changed the culture
{% endhint %}

* Changing ours words changed our world 
  * Replaced
    * Reactive language 
      * Convince, coerce, comply, conform
      * WITH Proactive language of intent & commitment to action 
    * A language of "prove & perform"
      * With a language of "Improve & learn" 
    * A language of invulnerability & certainty 
      * With a language of vulnerability & curiosity

### Sink of El Faro 

* Used an old playbook 
* A real danger to use old thinking in new situations 
* Language of the captain 
  * Binary affirmations 
    * "You know what I'm saying" 
    * "It's going to be between these 2, right ?" 
  * Justifying decision 
    * "Should work out OK"
  * No vulnerability displayed
    * Emotions are necessary for decision-making 
* They were programmed for 
  * Obeyed the clock when they should have controlled the clock 
  * The captain coerced the crew into compliance instead of collaboration 
  * The crew complied instead of having made their own commitment 
  * They continued to follow a monolithic plan instead of having completed 1 section at a time 
  * They were in prove mode instead of improve mode 
  * They conformed to their roles instead of connected with each other

### The new playbook

* 6 new leadership principles :
  * Control the clock instead of obeying the clock
  * Collaborate instead of coercing
  * Commitment rather than compliance 
  * Complete defined goals instead of continuing work indefinitely 
  * Improve outcomes rather than prove ability 
  * Connect with people instead of conforming to your role 
* Diverge first 
  * Allow each member to make his/her guess before being influenced 
  * Greatest possible diversity of thought 
  * WISDOM OF THE CROWD 
* 2 different kind of work
  * Decision-making \(Thinking\)
    * Bluework
      * "How do you see it ?" 
      * "What can we do better ?" 
  * Execution \(Doing\) 
    * Redwork 
      * "Get it done!" 
      * "Make it happen" 

{% hint style="success" %}
We are all both Redworkers and Blueworkers
{% endhint %}
