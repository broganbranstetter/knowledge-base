# How to make book infographics

Book infographic _is not something hard to do, just work and passion to share to be honest._

Here is the "process" I follow :

### 1) Read a book

* Yes that's not a really surprising step ðŸ˜Š
* Read the book by highlighting the passages that seem important
* Those on which the author insists and which seem to be at fault for the rest of the book
* Take notes: directly on the page or on another support

### 2) Centralize your book notes

* Because I read paper books, I retype my notes and key passages on my computer
* Add schemas if some

### 3) Filter your notes

Put your notes in a new file that will serve as a driver for the book infographic

* Based on the notes and passages in the book, make a selection
* We are not able to represent an entire book in graphic format : Limit yourself to a few key ideas and limit its explanation to a few bullet points

### 4) Infographic work

Once the "filtering" is done, we can start the infographic work

* To do this, I use: [https://www.canva.com/](https://www.canva.com)
  * The site contains templates to have a working base
  * Select a basic template and iterate on it
  * For each part:&#x20;
    * Put yourself in a part of the infographic and try to represent the information in a visual way based on your filtered notes (from previous step)
    * Ideally use 1 pictogram per main idea -> try to select some that have the same style
    * Few bullet points under the headlines : 2/3 lines maximum, the more visual, the better
    * The tool is a vector tool, you can group parts and resize them at will
* Once you have created the different parts that you want to appear on the book infographics, comes the longest moment: the assembly
  * Try to group the information in a coherent way by occupying the space
  * No worries if there are "blanks" in the infographic : we can easily fill them with geometric shapes to reinforce our design
  * I recommend to do several tests and ask for feedback : first feedback -> yours
    * Export it as a pdf or image and look at your infographic after a night of sleep
    * You'll see spelling mistakes and shifts or space occupancy that can be improved

### 5) Done

Once finalized, you just have to export it in PDF (high resolution) and that's it

### Some advice

* Do not reformulate author ideas (they are not yours and you could alter author ideas)
* It takes time to do it so you need to have a strong objective in mind
* Iterate a lot by taking others feedbacks

### Objective

I do it for multiple reasons:

* Book infographics allow me to anchor in my memory what I discover through a book.&#x20;
  * I have not found anything better at the moment.
* I love to learn by reading and there are books that you like so much that you want to share them with others.&#x20;
  * Through the infographics I hope to share my passion for these books and make others want to read them too.
