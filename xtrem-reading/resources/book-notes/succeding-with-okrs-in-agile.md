# Succeeding with OKRs in Agile

## Pitch <a href="title" id="title"></a>

OKRs are about goals bigger than the next story. OKRs prioritize purpose and strategy over backlogs. Objectives are big goals; key results are smaller goals that build towards the objective.

Does your agile team get lead astray by burning fires? Do you struggle to keep your agile team focused?

## Notes

### Short Quick lessons

* Bottom up
  * Don't impose OKRs from above
  * Don't set OKRs top-down
* Organization
  * OKRs are a team sport
* True north
  * Use OKRs to guide and fight to stay on course
  * Don't stick blindly to OKRs as the world around changes
* Leaders
  * Build psychological safety / make failure an option
  * Make completely clear what the organization's priorities are
* Reviewing
  * Ask questions as :
    * How does this create value ?
    * How will this be measured ?
    * Are these goals ambitious enough ?
    * Are the goals too ambitious ?
* Team
  * Make the team responsible for setting their own OKRs and delivering them
* Money
  * Do not link OKRs to bonuses and remuneration

### Introducing OKR

* OKRs = Objectives and key results
  * Objectives are Big Goals
  * Key results are smaller goals that build towards the objective
* Goals bring focus
  * Focus is powerful
* **OKRs = "Test Driven Management"**
  * Decide what you want (Objective)
  * Next set a series of acceptance criteria : key results
  * Get on and develop
  * Don't consider yourself done until you can pass the tests and meet the objectives
* Dissecting OKRs
  * OKR is something you and your team wish to achieve
  * Good OKRs are outcome-focused
    * Not about measuring progress towards a goal
    * Are all about delivering outcomes that add value
  * Each result should be useful in and of itself
* An objective should have its own wholeness that is more than the sum of its parts
  * Whole objective should create more value than simply the value of the Key Results added together
* OKRs get reviewed_** at the end of each quarter**_
* The real benefit is in the outcomes delivered
* _**Ambition over estimation**_
  * The aim of OKR
    * Not to do everything
    * **The aim is to be ambitious (push further)**
  * Teams are not normally expected to complete 100% of their OKRs
    * _**70% is more common**_
  * With OKRs teams are encouraged to **aim high**
    * Not impossibly high
    * BUT high enough to be challenged

### Why Use OKRs

* 3 reasons why OKRs work well with an agile approach
  * Fill a need at the mid-term planning level
  * OKRs are essentially a test-first approach
  * OKRs enhance communication
* Mid-term planning
  * Glue between the short-term daily / sprint planning and long-term plans
* Test-Driven OKRs
  * Each Objective has a set of Key Results
  * Each of these Key Results is a test 
    * Has the result been achieved
    * Each Key Result should be measurable
  * Test first approach
    * Creates focus
    * Tells you when to stop 
      * _Stop when the tests pass_
* Communication
  * Easier to communicate what a team is doing
  * A means of communicating status and progress
  * Success motivates continuation

### OKR History

* Management by Objective - Peter Drucker (1992)
  * Managers decide strategic objectives
  * Effort & Resources 
* OKR - Andy Grove at Intel 
  * Extended MBO with a focus on delivery

| MBOs                 | OKRs                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| What                 | What and How                     |
| Annual               | Quarterly or monthly             |
| Private and siloed   | Public and transparent           |
| Top-down             | Bottom-up or sideways            |
| Tied to compensation | Mostly divorce from compensation |
| Risk-averse          | Agressive and aspirational       |

### Outcomes, value and benefits

* Outcomes should be things in their own right
  * Not proxies for something else
* Outcomes should benefit customers
* Value and benefit are synonous
  * People tend to associate 'value' with a number
  * Benefits fits more easily when talking non financial value

#### Value

Value comes in many different forms

* Learning is valuable
  * Knowledge on new tech for example
* Feedback is valuable
  * Extend our existing knowledge
* Risk reduction is valuable
  * Increases the probability of delivering value
* Money
  * "Money is the best form of feedback"

#### Pieconomics

In [Grow the Pie](https://www.amazon.fr/Grow-Pie-Companies-Deliver-Purpose/dp/1108494854) 

* Taking a board-level 'stakeholder-value' approach to value
  * Rather than a narrow 'shareholder' value view
* Grow the pie so that there is more for all
* Compelling evidence that pursing a larger pie for all
  * creates non financial value
  * benefits society
  * brings financial rewards too

### Writing OKRs

* Quarterly writing of new OKRs is a strategy question :
  * _What are the strategic priorities for the next quarter ?_
  * _What does the team aim to do ?_
  * _What targets will the team set for itself ?_
* Prioritization is not just about deciding what to do
  * It is also deciding **what not to do**
  * Everything that is not in the OKRs is lower priority (by definition)
* OKRs operate within a cycle : prioritize, focus, execute, review

#### Team setting

* _Are you setting utility OKRs or aspirational OKRs ?_
  * One team may embrace ambition and aim high
  * Other teams may value predictability and set goals they are confident can be achieved
* Mark aspirations
  * Some teams mark objectives or key results that they feel to be aspirational

#### Limited number

* Aim of OKR = create focus
  * Self-defeating to set too many OKRs
* Teams exist to share work
  * TowarD a common purpose
  * OKRs serve to provide that purpose
* OKRs serve to help say "NO"
  * At least "Not Now"
* 3 is the maximum (Allan's recommendation)
  * This rule of thumb serves both for the number of O and the numbers of KRs

#### Priority

* All OKRs are not equals
  * Some might be higher priority
* Possible to prioritize Key Results independently of objectives
  * Example : KR1 of O1, KR1 of O2, KR2 and KR3 of O1, ...
  * Warning : it complicates matter

#### Effort

* In sprint or days per OKR
* Priority does not correspond to the capacity allocated

#### When to Set OKRs ?

* No specific time to set them
* Should not be set weeks and weeks in advance of the quarter they will apply
* Just a few weeks :
  * 2 or 3 should be fine

#### Not Money

Profit is a side effect of delivering on that purpose and creating value

### Objectives

* First thing to write = Objective
  * Something the organization wants / values
  * Something that contributes towards the bigger goals that leaders have outlined
* The thing you are trying to achieve
  * Perhaps the thing you are trying to build / create
  * A change you are seeking to make
* The objective doesn't need to explain the problem in detail
* Make the value the objective brings obvious
  * Example : 
    * Retool the delivery pipeline to facilitate CD
    * **VS **Increase ROI by reducing TTM with a new delivery pipeline and continuous delivery practices
  * Use the "so that"
* Avoid boxing yourself into a specific approach or solution

{% hint style="info" %}
One OKR for the team per quarter : nominated by the team to increase productive capacity
{% endhint %}

* Testing trouble : time
  * Some OKR can be measured after a specific amount of time
  * Can be marked as achieved
  * Final judgement for a later date

### Key Results

* Deliver value with each KR
* Fight against dominos
  * Don't accept dependencies
* Test-driven
  * KRs are the tests against which the objective will be measured
  * Example :
    * Make the site easy to use OR The site is secured
    * _Turn into testable statements_
    * New users can complete a purchase on the site within 5 minutes without cursing

###  KR tricks

* _**Experiments**_
  * Phrasing a key result as an experiment can be a useful way of attempting something with an uncertain outcome
    * Exemple : Run 3 experiments to increase page views
  * Success is doing the experiment itself and absorbing the learning
  * Like this it makes safer for the team to take on risk
*   _**Hypothesis-driven development**_

    * Template

    ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (601).png>)

    * Outcome of those KRs = learning
* Time-boxed
  * Experiment for 4 weeks for example
* Survey
  * Make changes to people
  * Test it with a survey

### Organizing to deliver OKRs

* 2 schools :
  * OKRs are additives
    * Add more work 
    * A new way of injecting work
  * OKRs are everything
    * OKRs = origin of all work and all organization

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (602).png>)

* OKRs everywhere
  * "Will this contribute to achieve the OKR?"
* Sprint planning with OKRs
  * Planning meeting needs to include a full review of the current OKRs
  * Direct the team to the highest prio OKR
  * Avoid the temptation to do a little of everything

#### Traffic lights and status

| Color  | Status      | Meaning                                         |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| White  | Not started |                                                 |
| Yellow | On course   |                                                 |
| Green  | Achieved    | No more work needed                             |
| Red    | Troubled    | Problems encounter                              |
| Purple | Abandoned   | Team has accepted the goal will not be achieved |

### OKRs and backlog

* 2 approaches :
  * Backlog first
  * OKRs first
    * Success
      * No longer burning down the backlog
      * Delivering OKRs
    * Choose Sprint Backlog items derived from the OKRs
      * Might be KRs themselves

### BAU 

* Problematic in an OKR driven world
  * Does not generate new business benefit
* Option 1 : suppress BAU
  * Force BAU to go away
* Option 2 : reduce or remove BAU
  * Set an OKR to reduce BAU
  * Think about google
    * Community support portal for example
* Option 3 : make BAU better
  * Make the work better
    * More efficient with better quality
* Option 4 : Objective 0
  * BAU in the OKRs
  * Objective 0 -> keep the existing system operation within the historic range
  * Add a 4th OKR for BAU here

### Beyond the quarter

* 3 horizons in terms of planning :
  * Now : sprint planning looks a few weeks into the future
  * Soon : OKRs look to the next few months
  * Later : looking months and years into the future
    * Can create valuable learning
      * Don't expect plans not to change 
      * What if thinking

{% hint style="info" %}
OKRs form a link between the big and possibly nebulous strategy and the specific-code face work of agile teams
{% endhint %}

* Don't forget technology
  * Technical excellence and consistently high quality = key strategy for agile teams
  * **Technical liabilities** over technical debt
    * Better metaphor
      * Debt has a good side (buy houses, ...)

### Leaders

* They need to set the context of work through culture, big goals and strategy elements
* They need to embody and live the culture as role models for the teams
* They can promote behaviors and decisions in line with the culture
* It is the myriad of tiny daily decisions that managers make that bring culture, goals, strategy into being

### Culture

* OKRs require supportive culture
  * Psychological safety
    * Failures will happen
    * _"if you aren't failing, you aren't trying"_
* Delivery culture
  * Culture needs to value delivery
  * Not hours worked, not partially done work
  * Delivery = actual working products being used by actual customers

### Aspirations

* Utility mode vs aspirational mode

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (603).png>)

### Warnings

{% hint style="danger" %}
Don't link remuneration to OKR outcomes
{% endhint %}

* Once money is attached to OKRs 
  * People feel compelled to chase 100% success
    * Easiest way = reduce the target
* Look at employee behavior instead
  * What behaviors would you like from your team members ?
  * What kind of behavior makes work go more smoothly ?

> As with agile, you need to find you own way to OKRs \[...] be prepared to experiment.
