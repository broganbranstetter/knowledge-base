# Succeding with OKRs in Agile

## Pitch <a id="title"></a>

OKRs are about goals bigger than the next story. OKRs prioritize purpose and strategy over backlogs. Objectives are big goals; key results are smaller goals that build towards the objective.

Does your agile team get lead astray by burning fires? Do you struggle to keep your agile team focused?

## Notes

### Short Quick lessons

* Bottom up
  * Don't impose OKRs from above
  * Don't set OKRs top-down
* Organization
  * OKRs are a team sport
* True north
  * Use OKRs to guide and fight to stay on course
  * Don't stick blindly to OKRs as the world around changes
* Leaders
  * Build psychological safety / make failure an option
  * Make completely clear what the organization's priorities are
* Reviewing
  * Ask questions as :
    * How does this create value ?
    * How will this be measured ?
    * Are these goals ambitious enough ?
    * Are the goals too ambitious ?
* Team
  * Make the team responsible for setting their own OKRs and delivering them
* Money
  * Do not link OKRs to bonuses and remuneration

### Introducing OKR

* OKRs = Objectives and key results
  * Objectives are Big Goals
  * Key results are smaller goals that build towards the objective
* Goals bring focus
  * Focus is powerful
* **OKRs = "Test Driven Management"**
  * Decide what you want \(Objective\)
  * Next set a series of acceptance criteria : key results
  * Get on and develop
  * Don't consider yourself done until you can pass the tests and meet the objectives
* Dissecting OKRs
  * OKR is something you and your team wish to achieve
  * Good OKRs are outcome-focused
    * Not about measuring progress towards a goal
    * Are all about delivering outcomes that add value
  * Each result should be useful in and of itself
* An objective should have its own wholeness that is more than the sum of its parts
  * Whole objective should create more value than simply the value of the Key Results added together
* OKRs get reviewed _**at the end of each quarter**_
* The real benefit is in the outcomes delivered
* _**Ambition over estimation**_
  * The aim of OKR
    * Not to do everything
    * **The aim is to be ambitious \(push further\)**
  * Teams are not normally expected to complete 100% of their OKRs
    * _**70% is more common**_
  * With OKRs teams are encouraged to **aim high**
    * Not impossibly high
    * BUT high enough to be challenged

### Why Use OKRs

* 3 reasons why OKRs work well with an agile approach
  * Fill a need at the mid-term planning level
  * OKRs are essentially a test-first approach
  * OKRs enhance communication
* Mid-term planning
  * Glue between the short-term daily / sprint planning and long-term plans
* Test-Driven OKRs
  * Each Objective has a set of Key Results
  * Each of these Key Results is a test 
    * Has the result been achieved
    * Each Key Result should be measurable
  * Test first approach
    * Creates focus
    * Tells you when to stop 
      * _Stop when the tests pass_
* Communication
  * Easier to communicate what a team is doing
  * A means of communicating status and progress
  * Success motivates continuation

### OKR History

* Management by Objective - Peter Drucker \(1992\)
  * Managers decide strategic objectives
  * Effort & Resources 
* OKR - Andy Grove at Intel 
  * Extended MBO with a focus on delivery

| MBOs | OKRs |
| :--- | :--- |
| What | What and How |
| Annual | Quarterly or monthly |
| Private and siloed | Public and transparent |
| Top-down | Bottom-up or sideways |
| Tied to compensation | Mostly divorce from compensation |
| Risk-averse | Agressive and aspirational |

### Outcomes, value and benefits

* Outcomes should be things in their own right
  * Not proxies for something else
* Outcomes should benefit customers
* Value and benefit are synonous
  * People tend to associate 'value' with a number
  * Benefits fits more easily when talking non financial value

#### Value

* Learning is valuable
  * Knowledge on new tech for example
* Feedback is valuable
  * Extend our existing knowledge
* Risk reduction is valuable
  * Increases the probability of delivering value
* Money
  * "Money is the best form of feedback"

#### Pieconomics

In [Grow the Pie](https://www.amazon.fr/Grow-Pie-Companies-Deliver-Purpose/dp/1108494854) 

* Taking a board-level 'stakeholder-value' approach to value
  * Rather than a narrow 'shareholder' value view
* Grow the pie so that there is more for all
* Compelling evidence that pursing a larger pie for all
  * creates non financial value
  * benefits society
  * brings financial rewards too
