# Agile People: A Radical Approach for HR & Managers

## Pitch <a href="title" id="title"></a>

Corporate cultures, global mindsets, and employee priorities are changing, which means management and human resources departments must also evolve. To ensure teams are well crafted, motivated, and successful, managers and HR professionals must step outside their comfort zone and adapt to younger, newer ways of thinkingâ€”they must become Agile.

{% endhint %}

Ensure teams are 

* Well crafted 
* Motivated
* Successful
* Mangers must step outside their comfort zone

### The agile recruitment manifesto

Keys = Transparency + Team involved

### Know people

* Real character 
* Invite candidates
  * Spend a day with the people
  * Speak with a wide range of people
* Must have diversity in the talent pool

### Traditional way vs agile way

Evaluate competence vs Evaluate values and cultural fit

### 70:20:10 Model 

* 70% : knowledge is learned through XP 
* 20% : Through coaching, mentoring, relationships 
* 10% Through structured course

Learning is the only way to adapt

### Agile learning

Learn more effectively in small amounts

Design :

* Their own schedule
* To-do list
* Goals
