# Domain-Driven Design: The First 15 Years

## Pitch

Fifteen years after the publication of "Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software" by Eric Evans, DDD is gaining more adoption than ever. 

To celebrate the anniversary, we've asked _**prominent authors in the software design world to contribute old and new essays**_.

A collaborative book sponsored by Domain-Driven Design Europe

* Candidate System boundaries

#### Heuristics 

* Look at the Business phases 
  * Follow the money 
* Look at the swimlanes 
  * Show different paths that involve different models 
* Look at the people on the paper roll 
  * “twist might happen when dealing with different personas” 
* Look at the body language 
* Listen to the actual language 
* Look at the humans in the room 
  * Different people are a great indicator of different needs which means different models
