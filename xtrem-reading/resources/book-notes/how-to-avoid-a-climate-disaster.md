# How to avoid a Climate Disaster

## Pitch

**\#1 NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER**

**In this urgent, authoritative book, Bill Gates sets out a wide-ranging, practical—and** _**accessible—**_**plan for how the world can get to zero greenhouse gas emissions in time to avoid a climate catastrophe.**  
  
Bill Gates has spent a decade investigating the causes and effects of climate change. With the help of experts in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, political science, and finance, he has focused on what must be done in order to stop the planet’s slide to certain environmental disaster. In this book, he not only explains why we need to work toward net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases, but also details what we need to do to achieve this profoundly important goal.  
  
He gives us a clear-eyed description of the challenges we face. Drawing on his understanding of innovation and what it takes to get new ideas into the market, he describes the areas in which technology is already helping to reduce emissions, where and how the current technology can be made to function more effectively, where breakthrough technologies are needed, and who is working on these essential innovations. Finally, he lays out a concrete, practical plan for achieving the goal of zero emissions—suggesting not only policies that governments should adopt, but what we as individuals can do to keep our government, our employers, and ourselves accountable in this crucial enterprise.  
  
As Bill Gates makes clear, achieving zero emissions will not be simple or easy to do, but if we follow the plan he sets out here, it is a goal firmly within our reach.

## Book notes

### Introduction - 51 billion to zero

* 2 numbers you need to know about climate :
  * 51 billion
    * Tons of greenhouse gases the world typically adds to the atmosphere every year
    * _**Where we are today**_
  * zero
    * _**What we need to aim for**_
* Convinced of 3 things
  1. To avoid a climate disaster, we have to get to zero
  2. We need to deploy the tools we already have, like solar and wind, faster and smarter
  3. And we need to create and roll out breakthrough technologies that can take us the rest of the way

_The climate is like a bathtub that's slowly filling up with water. Even if we slow the flow of water to a trickle, the tub will eventually fill up and water will come spilling out onto the floor._
{% endhint %}

* COVID-19
  * 5 percent reduction
  * Because economic activity has slowed down

### Chapter 1 - Why zero ?

* Getting to zero doesn't mean "zero"
  * It means "near net zero"
* The earth is warming
  * Because of human activity
  * We have every reason to believe that at some point the impact will be catastrophic
  * We don't know precisely WHEN \(30 years ? 50 years ? ...\)
  * We need to act now
* Already raised 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial times
  * mid-century : probably between 1.5 and 3 degrees Celsius
  * end of century : between 4 and 8 degrees Celsius
* A 2-degree rise wouldn't simply be 33 percent worse than 1.5
  * Could be 100 percent worse
    * Twice as many people would have trouble getting clean water
    * Corn production in the tropics would go down twice as much
    * Mosquitoes will start living in new places
      * Malaria
    * Heatstroke will be another major problem
      * Because of humidity
* Using data from the Spanish flu of 1918and COVID-19
  * The amount by which a global pandemic increases the global mortality rate : **14 deaths per 100,000 people each year**
  * By mid-century climate change could represent the same amount than COVID-19 : 
    * **14 deaths per 100,000 people each year**
  * By the end of century : could be responsible for ****
    * **75 extra deaths per 100,000 people each year**
    * **By 2100 could be five times as deadly than COVID**
  * 2 things we can do about it 
    * **Adaptation** : minimize the impact of the changes that are already here and that we know are coming
    * **Mitigation** : stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere
      * Biggest emitters \(richest countries\) have to get top net-zero emissions by 2050
