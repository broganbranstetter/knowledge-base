# How to avoid a Climate Disaster

## Pitch

**\#1 NEW YORK TIMES BEST SELLER**

**In this urgent, authoritative book, Bill Gates sets out a wide-ranging, practical—and** _**accessible—**_**plan for how the world can get to zero greenhouse gas emissions in time to avoid a climate catastrophe.**  
  
Bill Gates has spent a decade investigating the causes and effects of climate change. With the help of experts in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, political science, and finance, he has focused on what must be done in order to stop the planet’s slide to certain environmental disaster. In this book, he not only explains why we need to work toward net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases, but also details what we need to do to achieve this profoundly important goal.  
  
He gives us a clear-eyed description of the challenges we face. Drawing on his understanding of innovation and what it takes to get new ideas into the market, he describes the areas in which technology is already helping to reduce emissions, where and how the current technology can be made to function more effectively, where breakthrough technologies are needed, and who is working on these essential innovations. Finally, he lays out a concrete, practical plan for achieving the goal of zero emissions—suggesting not only policies that governments should adopt, but what we as individuals can do to keep our government, our employers, and ourselves accountable in this crucial enterprise.  
  
As Bill Gates makes clear, achieving zero emissions will not be simple or easy to do, but if we follow the plan he sets out here, it is a goal firmly within our reach.

## Book notes

### Introduction - 51 billion to zero

* 2 numbers you need to know about climate :
  * 51 billion
    * Tons of greenhouse gases the world typically adds to the atmosphere every year
    * _**Where we are today**_
  * zero
    * _**What we need to aim for**_
* Convinced of 3 things
  1. To avoid a climate disaster, we have to get to zero
  2. We need to deploy the tools we already have, like solar and wind, faster and smarter
  3. And we need to create and roll out breakthrough technologies that can take us the rest of the way

{% hint style="info" %}
_The climate is like a bathtub that's slowly filling up with water. Even if we slow the flow of water to a trickle, the tub will eventually fill up and water will come spilling out onto the floor._
{% endhint %}

* COVID-19
  * 5 percent reduction
  * Because economic activity has slowed down

### Chapter 1 - Why zero ?

* Getting to zero doesn't mean "zero"
  * It means "near net zero"
* The earth is warming
  * Because of human activity
  * We have every reason to believe that at some point the impact will be catastrophic
  * We don't know precisely WHEN \(30 years ? 50 years ? ...\)
  * We need to act now
* Already raised 1 degree Celsius since preindustrial times
  * mid-century : probably between 1.5 and 3 degrees Celsius
  * end of century : between 4 and 8 degrees Celsius
* A 2-degree rise wouldn't simply be 33 percent worse than 1.5
  * Could be 100 percent worse
    * Twice as many people would have trouble getting clean water
    * Corn production in the tropics would go down twice as much
    * Mosquitoes will start living in new places
      * Malaria
    * Heatstroke will be another major problem
      * Because of humidity
* Using data from the Spanish flu of 1918and COVID-19
  * The amount by which a global pandemic increases the global mortality rate : **14 deaths per 100,000 people each year**
  * By mid-century climate change could represent the same amount than COVID-19 : 
    * **14 deaths per 100,000 people each year**
  * By the end of century : could be responsible for ****
    * **75 extra deaths per 100,000 people each year**
    * **By 2100 could be five times as deadly than COVID**
  * 2 things we can do about it 
    * **Adaptation** : minimize the impact of the changes that are already here and that we know are coming
    * **Mitigation** : stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere
      * Biggest emitters \(richest countries\) have to get top net-zero emissions by 2050

### Chapter 2 - This will be hard

* Fossil fuels are like water
  * "important realities are often the ones that are the hardest to see and talk about" - David Foster Wallace
  * Fossil fuels are like that
* Oil
  * The world uses more than 4 billion gallons every day
  * _Oil is cheaper than a soft drink_

* It's not just the rich world
  * almost everywhere people are living longer and healthier lives
  * Would be immoral and impractical to try to stop people who are lower down on the economic ladder from climbing up
    * Can't expect poor people to stay poor because rich countries emitted too many greenhouse gases

{% hint style="info" %}
We need to make it possible for low-income people to climb the ladder without making climate change worse.
{% endhint %}

* Our laws and regulations are so outdated
  * Environmental laws and regulations weren't designed with climate change in mind
  * Clean Air Act -&gt; 1970
* We need to build a consensus that doesn't exist and create public policies to push a transition that would not happen otherwise
  * _**Don't despair, we can do this**_

### Chapter 3 - 5 questions to ask in every climate conversation

* Build a mental framework
  * Gave a sense of how much was a lot and how much was a little

1. How much of the 51 Billion Tons are we talking about ?
   * Convert numbers into a percentage of the annual total of 51 billion tons
2. What's your plan for Cement ?
   * A shorthand reminder that if you're trying to come up with a comprehensive plan for climate change, you have to account for much than electricity and cars
   * **Emissions come from 5 different activities** 
     * We need solutions in all of them

3. How much power are we talking about?

| Whenever you hear : | Think |
| :--- | :--- |
| Kilowatt | House |
| Gigawatt | City |
| A hundred or more gigawatts | big country |

4. How much space do you need ?

* If someone tells you that some source : wind, solar, nuclear, ... can supply all the energy the world needs
  * Find out how much space will be required to produce that much energy
  * Examples : Wind -&gt; 1-2 Watts per square meter, Fossil Fuels -&gt; 500-10,000 Watts per Square Meter

5. How much this is going to cost ?

* Most of the zero-carbon solutions are more expensive than their fossil-fuel counterparts
  * Because the prices don't reflect the environmental damage they influct
  * These additional costs are what I call _**Green Premiums**_
    * The difference between the 2 prices
    * It can be negative : greeen can be cheaper than sticking with fossil fuels

{% hint style="info" %}
We need the premiums to be so low that everyone will be able to decarbonize.
{% endhint %}

### Chapter 4 - How we plug in

`27 percent of 51 billion tons per year`
