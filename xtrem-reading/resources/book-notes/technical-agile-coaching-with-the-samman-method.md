# Technical Agile Coaching with the Samman Method

## Pitch

Agile Coaching helps an organization to be more successful, by increasing agility. 

Samman Technical Coaching is **a kind of Agile Coaching that specializes in technical questions concerning how code is written**. It's an aspect of agility that is often glossed over, and can be crucial for success. This book explains the best method I know of to increase agility amongst software developers. You help them improve coding practices and how they collaborate. It's fun and challenging for the coach too.

_The first part of the method is working in an ensemble with development teams, programming in their production codebase. To complement this hands-on mentoring, the second part of the method is short daily "learning hour" sessions to practice particular techniques_. In this book you will learn about the Samman coaching method and how to do it in practice. From the details of daily coaching work to marketing your services and how to find a suitable assignment. It is a practical handbook for an aspiring coach and contains fresh ideas for an experienced coach looking for new ways of working.
