# Technical Agile Coaching with the Samman Method

## Pitch

Agile Coaching helps an organization to be more successful, by increasing agility. 

Samman Technical Coaching is **a kind of Agile Coaching that specializes in technical questions concerning how code is written**. It's an aspect of agility that is often glossed over, and can be crucial for success. This book explains the best method I know of to increase agility amongst software developers. You help them improve coding practices and how they collaborate. It's fun and challenging for the coach too.

_The first part of the method is working in an ensemble with development teams, programming in their production codebase. To complement this hands-on mentoring, the second part of the method is short daily "learning hour" sessions to practice particular techniques_. In this book you will learn about the Samman coaching method and how to do it in practice. From the details of daily coaching work to marketing your services and how to find a suitable assignment. It is a practical handbook for an aspiring coach and contains fresh ideas for an experienced coach looking for new ways of working.

## Notes

### Foreword by Kent Beck

* "Software development is best seen as a learning process where running programs are the proof of ****learning, rather than a factory or production process. That’s the first idea I found in Samman."
* "Walking a new path together along with an experienced guide reduces time spent not learning because of fear. That’s the second idea."

### Samman Technical Coaching

* A method for people who want to make a difference and **improve the way software is built**.
* **Focus ?**
  * Specifically on technical practices 
  * How people write code
* **Foundation / prerequisite ?** 
  * Cultivate good relationships with the people you work with
  * The rest is about effective ways to learn from one another and to change behaviours for the long term.
* **2 main parts to the method :**
  * **Learning Hour** : ****the coach uses exercises and active learning techniques to teach the theory and practice of skills like Test-Driven Development and Refactoring
  * **Ensemble Working** : In the Ensemble sessions 
    * Whole team collaborates together with the coach in applying agile development techniques in their usual production codebase
* **Samman and Ensemble ?**
  * ‘Samman’ word describes this coaching method
    * “Samman” is a Swedish word that means “together”
  * “Ensemble” is a French word meaning “together”
* Why use those words ? \(no Mob for instance\)
  * to distinguish this method from other ways to do coaching and make it easier to search for on the internet

### **Why would an organization engage in Samman Technical Coaching ?**

{% hint style="info" %}
_To increase business agility and success if a company is building a software product, then the way people write code actually matters quite a lot._
{% endhint %}

* **Good technical practices** : mean the organization can build new features with a shorter lead

  time and higher quality

  * Meeting deadlines 
  * Deliver reliable software.

  _**This brings happier customers and a successful business.**_

* Skilled developers will want to work for an organization with high quality code, effective development practices and a healthy culture.
* The company needs to avoid drowning in technical debt. 
  * If it piles up too much developers will ultimately be unable to deliver any new features in a timely or cost effective manner. 
  * Serious risk for any business.

### Elevator pitch for Samman Technical Coaching

In order to be successful in modern development organizations, software developers need new skills. These skills are not easily learnt on a short training course or at a university. Practices like Continuous Integration and Test-Driven Development require developers to change their minute-by-minute habits and ways of working.

As with any new skills, the way to learn is through a combination of teaching and practice. The Samman method includes a series of short lessons called ‘learning hour’. The coach uses active learning techniques that are proven to be more effective than lectures. We work together on code katas and other exercises so developers both understand the new techniques in theory and experience them in carefully chosen examples.

The Samman coaching method is also on-the-job, together with developers in their usual situation. In order to change the way developers work it’s often not enough to only practice on code katas and learn theory. The coach works together with development teams in a structured collaboration called an ‘ensemble’. We learn how to apply relevant techniques in the actual production code the team works with daily.

### Development techniques 

* _Better unit tests_
  * Developers should deliver a suite of automated unit tests together with the code they write. 
  * Tests 
    * Demonstrate each part of the code works as the authors intended
    * Documents their assumptions
    * Provide **a safety-net for refactoring and make maintenance less costly**
* _Continuous Integration_
  * Know the incremental design and refactoring techniques 
  * To be able to integrate often : avoid merge conflicts
* _Safe refactoring in legacy code_
* _Incremental and Iterative Development_
