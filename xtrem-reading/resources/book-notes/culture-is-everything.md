# Culture is everything

## Pitch

How One Company Is Redefining The Meaning Of Going To Work

Tristan White’s story started like many others. He had a dream to work in a job that inspired him. He didn’t find that job, so he created it. 

In 2004, The Physio Co \(TPC\) was born with one team member: Tristan White. In the thirteen years since, TPC has become a remarkable healthcare success story based upon fast growth and a thriving, systemized company culture. 

Tristan’s obsession with creating an inspiring place to work for himself and others has resulted in more than a decade of learning, testing and refining. If you’ve ever wondered how to build and sustain a thriving company culture, the Culture Is Everything system developed by Tristan White and The Physio Co team is your answer. 

The Physio Co story and Culture Is Everything system explained in this book will give you the confidence and knowledge to create a strong culture in your very own business or team.

## Notes

### His 5 beliefs of Meaningful Work 

I believe : 

* We spend so much time working that we have to find a way to enjoy it. 
* We enjoy work when we feel proud of doing the right thing in challenging situations. 
* We enjoy work when we’re doing something useful for others. 
* We enjoy work when there are defined boundaries around what we should be doing and we have some freedom around how to do it. 
* Every team, business and organisation can create this ‘freedom within boundaries’ environment that is

### 1\) Discover the Core

#### Core purpose

> _**A core purpose is the reason an organisation exists**_

* Ref "Good to Great", by Jim Collins 
* How to ? 
  * It absolutely has to be inspiring to those inside the organisation. 
  * It has to be something that could be as valid a hundred years from now as it is today. 
  * It should help you think expansively about what you could do but aren't doing. 
  * It should help you decide what not to do. 
  * It has to be truly authentic to your company. \(Teams that fail on this important point are often the ones that really don’t stand for anything and never will.\) 
* At Physio CO : _**"to help seniors stay mobile, safe and happy"**_

#### 3 to 5 core values

* That inspire great behavior 
* Make them short, sharp and memorable 
* Each value should be an action statement

    * We are committed to constantly improving, personally and collectively.
    * We inspire others by continually finding a better way. 
  * Think Big, Act Small : ‘We are David, not Goliath’ :
    * We are always prepared to ‘give it a go’.
    * We are nimble, flexible and easygoing.
    * We always ask: ‘What can I do next?’
    * We all help to achieve our Painted Picture of the future.

#### Sharing Core Value Stories to reward / recognise / reeducate 

* A values-based business, results in a commitment that core values become the basis of everything.
