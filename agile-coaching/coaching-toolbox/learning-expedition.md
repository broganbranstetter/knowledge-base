# Learning expedition

Imagine that you have just returned from a "_**learning expedition**_" in companies where you have observed... (a very beautiful form of agility for example)

You are now back at your own office.

> _**It's time to share your memories.**_

## How to ?

Split the group in smaller ones (of 4 to 5 people)

At the end of the exercise, the objective for the team is to present their consolidated observations.

1. **Initiation** : in solo, ask to the participants to write as many observations as they made during their expedition (on sticky note to easily reorganize ideas). - _**5'**_
2. **Sharing** (1/2) : participants share inside their group their observations. - _**5'**_
3. **Reflective break** : each group take a reflective break to decide which actions they need to do to be able to reach their objective - _**2'**_
4. **Sharing** (2/2) : each group continues the sharing part - _**5'**_
5. **Finalize your story** : finalize group story by clustering ideas and agree on the story telling - _**5'**_

### Global sharing / Pollination - 15'

* Let each group decides who will present the story of their own group
* The other participants can go to the other groups  and listen their stories - **10'**
* All the participants go back to their initial groups and share their discoveries - **5'**
