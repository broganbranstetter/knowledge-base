# How to run a Community of Practices \(COP\)

## Community of Practices

### What is it ?

A group of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they _**interact regularly**_.

### Its purpose

* Connect people / break silos
* Consolidate the collective knowledge
* Improve quality
* Spread knowledge
* Standardize practices in the organization
* Share practices
* Build new skills / learn together
* Build a learning organization
* Solve problems by using the collective intelligence

### Who ?

* 1 leader / facilitator
  * Keep it alive
  * Organize the events
  * Motivate people
* 1 core of people / Volunteers
  * To participate and contribute

In fact in Community of Practice you can observe 3 types of participants :

* _**Takers**_ : self-focused and put their own interests ahead of others’ needs. They try to gain as much as possible from their interactions while contributing as little as they can in return.
* _**Matchers**_ : like to preserve an equal balance of giving and taking. 
  * Their mindset is: “If you take from me, I’ll take from you. If you give to me, I’ll give to you.”
* _**Givers**_ : are others-focused, and tend to provide support to others with no strings attached. 
  * They ask themselves, “How can I add value for this person? What can I contribute?”

### Communication is key

* Create the buzz around you community
  * Make it viral
* Choose the right channels
* Be consistent in your communications
  * Brand it internally

### Examples of Events of a COP

* Organize [Brown Bag sessions](https://www.dlgdigital.co.uk/news/what-is-a-brown-bag-session)
  * 1 speaker on a dedicated topic
  * Spread/Share knowledge
* [Lightning taks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk)
  * Everyone can share a few minutes on 1 topic
* [Lean coffees](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/)
  * Solve problems by using Collective Intelligence
* Xtrems format : learn collaboratively

### How

There are some key steps when introducing a COP. This kind of initiative can be associate to a change process :

* Define the goals of the community
  * Do it collaboratively with those who see the needs to create one
* Sell the idea internally
  * Find sponsors
* Initiate a backlog
* Kick-off the community
* Run your first events
* Introduce Continuous Improvement process
  * Gather feedback regularly
  * Organize retrospective
  * Check regularly if you meet the goals you defined

## How to bootstrap yours ?

Here is the facilitation format I use to help organizations bootstrap their own COP.

During a 2 hours workshop you can invite motivated people on the topic you want to create a COP about \(examples : software development, UX, Agile, Analysts, Project Managers, ...\).

{% hint style="success" %}
The goal of the workshop : _**Co-construct a first version of a community vision.**_
{% endhint %}

I use a divergent / convergent format with individual / collective reflection times.

### 1\) Vision / Importance

You need to be sure that everyone agrees and is aligned on the Vision and why the community is important at this stage.

### 2\) How / Measures

### 3\) Impact \(on what / who\)

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28426%29.png)

### 4\) Resources

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28421%29.png)

### 5\) Force Field Analysis \(Optional\)

Anticipate what could support the Community Vision and what could slow it down.

### 6\) Choose a name

Naming is always important so choose it all together as well.

`At this moment you can also elect a leader for the Community.`

### COP Canva

You can then format the outcome of the workshop into a Canva that you can display everywhere like the one below :

## Success criteria

From my experience here are some key success criteria for your COPs :

* _**Co-construction**_ is key
  * Involve people from the beginning \(Vision\)
  * Collaboratively refine your backlog
* Have _**1 and only 1 leader**_
  * I have already seen COPs with several leaders
    * On the paper I like the idea : no Single Point Of Failure, load is split
  * But I have never seen it worked so I prefer to recommend to have only 1 leader
* A leader with _**dedicated time**_ on it
  * Lead / facilitate a COP takes time
  * It must not be a Nice To Have activity
  * Must be part of the person's job
* Leader needs to _**be coached**_ at the beginning
  * Often on the skills
  * How to federate and involve people
* _**Transparency**_ everywhere on everything
  * Every events should be public
  * Measures of the progress as well
  * Keep a log of everything
  * Publish event minutes and contents on a dedicated platform \(Slack, Wiki, ...\)
* Have a _**strong sponsorship**_
  * From the management
  * Gather resources
  * Not a nice to have activity for people
  * Need to be convinced that it's a way to evolve as an organization
* _**Use different event\(s\) format\(s\)**_
  * Vary the pleasures
* _**Autonomy**_
  * Autonomy means clear responsibility as well
  * Have a clear boundary on what can be done within the COP / clear vision
    * Examples : create standards for programming in the organization
* _**Involve people**_
  * Create a safe place for people \(without judgement\)
  * The key to involve them
  * _**`No need to be an expert to share. It's by sharing that you will become an expert.`**_
* _**Reflect**_ regularly on the community
  * Do it with a survey \(self assessment\) based on the outcomes expected from the Vision
  * Organize retrospectives
  * You can use the self assessment questions below \(I recommend to adapt them regarding your own COP vision\)
