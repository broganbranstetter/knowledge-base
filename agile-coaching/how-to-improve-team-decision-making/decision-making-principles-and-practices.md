# Decision Making Principles and Practices

## Introduction

The better resource I use on this topic is the book [_**27 Decision making principles and practices**_](https://leanpub.com/decision-making-principles) _****_from [Jimmy Janlen](https://twitter.com/jimmyjanlen)

I strongly invite you to buy the book on leanpub. In this post I will just give some pieces of it.

Self-organized teams need to master the skill of having efficient and constructive discussions that engage and involve everyone.

{% hint style="info" %}
Teams must learn :

* How to reach strong inclusive agreements
  * With clear decisions and next steps
* How to make decisions fast
{% endhint %}

### What is the risk of failing in decision making ?

Often teams struggle in this area and get stuck in decision paralysis. It doesn’t serve anyone and can really block from being competitive.

Failing to agree as a team, resorting to “_**the boss decides**_”.

It will undermine commitment, create conflicts and grudges, and quickly compromising the team.

## Always have a facilitator

{% hint style="success" %}
Always ensure you have a facilitator for each and every meeting
{% endhint %}

If you don't have a dedicated facilitator in your team you can :

* Elect one at the beginning of the meeting
* Rotate the facilitator responsibility \(according to you\)
  * For each meeting
  * Per week
  * Per sprint
  * Whatever

## How to propose ?

Before deciding anything we need to work on how to propose something. It's the first step before getting ready for decision taking.

### Present, Discuss, Improve

* Allow the person with an idea to present the proposal
* If a proposal has emerged through a discussion
  * Nominate a team member to summarize and present the proposal as he/she has understood it
  * This person becomes the temporary facilitator

During the presentation everyone takes notes.

Once the presentation is done :

* Clarifying questions are asked
* Ideas for improving the proposal are discussed
* Concerns are raised, and if possible used to further **improve the proposal**

### Survey with fist of five 

Participants express their current opinion about the direction of the discussion and the emerging proposal by voting with their fingers.

On a scale from 1 to 5, "_**How much closer do you think we are to an acceptable proposal ?**_" :

* 1 : far, far, far away
* 5 : We have reached an acceptable proposal

{% hint style="success" %}
Sometimes, despite discussions and concerns the group as a whole might actually agree that there is an acceptable proposal.
{% endhint %}

### Design proposals as experiment

Design a proposal as an experiment invites you to identify concerns that should be paid particular attention to in the evaluation. 

* What is the hypothesis? 
* How would we know if the decision has the intended impact? 
* How can we evaluate? 
* How would we be able to gauge or measure whether or not we need to revisit the decision and make adjustments, or try something else? 
* Can we set a date for an evaluation or retrospective?

I like to use this simple template when I formulate an experiment :

It forces us to formulate our experiment and structure them.

##  How to decide ?

## **How to stimulate** _****_**t**eam wisdom ?
