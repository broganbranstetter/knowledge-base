### Dixit problem solving

Find a volunteer among the participants who recently had an issue regarding decision making inside his/her team.

Ask to the volunteer :

* Draw a random card
  * Ask this question : "_**How this card represents the situation you encountered ?**_"
    * Ask for details on the card \(only open questions\)
    * Example : "What about this color ?"
    * The others are invited to ask questions as well
* Once everyone understood the problem, the volunteer is invited to draw a second card
  * Ask this question : "_**How this card represents a solution to your previous problem that you could have experimented at the time ?**_"
    * The others are invited to ask questions as well
    * They can also propose solutions by referring to the card
* Draw a last card :
  * Ask this question : "_**Imagine you had tried the solution you identified on the second card, what happened?**_"

### Debrief the activity with all the participants :

* _What value did you see in this activity ?_
* _What did you learn ?_
* _How it has been helpful ?_
