### Dixit problem solving

Find a volunteer among the participants who recently had an issue regarding decision making inside his/her team.

Ask to the volunteer :

* Draw a random card
  * Ask this question : "_**How this card represents the situation you encountered ?**_"
    * Ask for details on the card \(only open questions\)
    * Example : "What about this color ?"
    * The others are invited to ask questions as well
* Once everyone understood the problem, the volunteer is invited to draw a second card
  * Ask this question : "_**How this card represents a solution to your previous problem that you could have experimented at the time ?**_"
    * The others are invited to ask questions as well
    * They can also propose solutions by referring to the card
* Draw a last card :
  * Ask this question : "_**Imagine you had tried the solution you identified on the second card, what happened?**_"

### Debrief the activity with all the participants :

* _What value did you see in this activity ?_
* _What did you learn ?_
* _How it has been helpful ?_

## Concrete Practice

### Feedforward 

The "feedforward" consists to formulate requests or propose future-oriented options or solutions, as opposed to the feedback technique, which looks back on a past situation.

_**Example**_ : _**For your next**_ report, I suggest that you divide the summary of your activities by date or by function \(budget, planning, operations management, ...\). _**So that**_ it will be easier to read it, to find the information I need and to refer to it later.

Regarding decision making formulate a _FeedForward_ to yourself : _**For your next ... I invite you to .... so that...**_

## Conclusion

A simple ROTI.
