# Learning 3.0

The principles on this page come from the book [Learning 3.0 : How creative workers learn](https://www.amazon.fr/How-Creative-Workers-Learn-creativity-ebook/dp/B013K8K1CU) from Alexandre Magno.

## 2 types of learning

### Prescriptive

* Based on knowledge and skills that are pre-determined for the learners.
* Learners = empty containers into which the expert must deposit knowledge.

### Emergent

* Self-organized learning.
* Arises in unpredictable environments within a context in which learners organize :
  * The process
  * The learning destinations

## 3 versions of learning

## Learning 3.0

* All _**about stories and ideas **_more than about lessons and advice 
* Learning is _**related to real work**_; it’s not outside it
* The one who learns becomes the _**protagonist**_, having higher (or total) influence on the product and on the process of learning
* _**Learning emerges from the connection of stories, ideas, and practice**_, and equal discussion through a problematized situation from the real world
* Challenging good and best practices is encouraged from the _**intentional confrontation of multiple perspectives**_
* _**Viewing the learning is more important than measuring it**_

### The Creative Worker

* A creative worker is someone who, _**when faced with a problem, raises alternatives instead of limiting herself to known solutions**_.
* A big part of the abilities you will need to discover _**start with the word “self”**_: e.g. self-knowledge, self-discovery, self-development, and self-motivation.
* For creative workers, the _**learning must emerge from practice**_, of real problems and solutions.
* Creative workers create and nurture communities around them and through those communities emerges a big part of the learning necessary to deal with the professional challenges of the twenty-first century.
