# Retrospectives

## **5 steps**

* **Set the stage** : Regardless of what we discover, we understand that everyone did the best job he or she could
* **Gather data** : What went well and what did not.
* **Generate insights** : Teams typically identify why things happened and what should be done more, done less and tried out.
* **Decide what to do** : Deciding on specific, meaningful, agreed and realistic actions that will be done in the next Sprint
* **Close the retrospective** : R.O.T.I

## Anti patterns

* What happens in retro, does not stay in retro
  * The retrospective is a safe place : communicates only the taken actions
* Change the world&#x20;
  * Small changes : do not try to change everything at once
* No time to improve
  * Improvement is part of the life of any team
  * Time needs to be taken
* No responsibility is taken (The scrum master will do it)
  * Team responsibility (Not a 1 person job)
* Wishful thinking actions
  * Concrete actions, [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART\_criteria) actions
* Managers want to attend
  * It is not good : safe place (silence law with managers)
* One man show
  * Everyone has the right/duty to speak
  * Scrum Master has to make this happen
* No review of past action items
  * Every actions must be followed
